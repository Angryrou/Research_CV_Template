# Research_CV_Template
A clean and crisp CV template built over time by [Aditya Kusupati](www.adityakusupati.com) on top of Theodore P. Pavlic's original class file.

Works seamlessly in online LaTeX editors just by uploading the tex/zip file or can be compiled using the Makefile which only needs pdflatex.

Anyone can use this template for non-commercial use: which basically covers most of the cases we use our CVs.
